# CircuitPython controlled Cute Gauge

This is a modification of Cyrill KÃ¼nzi's cute CO2 gauge that he described here: https://kuenzi.dev/co2/. His original implementation integrates with Home Assistant but I needed it to be standalone for my purposes so I used CircuitPython with an Adafruit QTPY ESP32 and a CO2 sensor and wrote some [code](code.py).

I used the following parts in my build:
- DS3225 Servo, this matches what was used originally (I used this one from [Amazon](https://a.co/d/9nq5n7Z))
- QT PY ESP32-S2 from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5325)
- A SCD30 CO2 sensor from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4867) - had one of these left over from a previous project, you could go with one of the cheaper ones like [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5190). I'd recommend a true CO2 sensor, not one that only provides eCO2. This seem to be iffy in my experience.
- A STEMMA QT cable ([Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4399))

I also modified the original case to add some venting since I was shoving the ESP32 and the CO2 sensor inside and wanted a little airflow so the readings were reasonable. You can find the modifed part [here](https://github.com/avnc/co2_gauge/tree/main/stl). You'll need Cyrill's original STL also, I've only included the modified part here. It's available in his GitHub [repo](https://github.com/ckuenzi/co2-gauge).

The wiring is very simple. The SCD30 is connected via the STEMMA QT cable to the QT PY's STEMMA QT connector. The motor is connected to the 5v power, ground and TX pins of the QT PY. You'll need to take the data wire out of the 3 pin Dupont female connector the motor comes with and put on a new single pin female connector assuming you have headers on your ESP32. Alternately just solder,

Looks like this:

I printed the modified case part with Amolen wood grain PLA, looks like this when all assembled:
